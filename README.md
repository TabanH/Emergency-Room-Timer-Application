# Emergency-Room-Timer-Application (ERTA)
Introduction:  
The Emergency Room Timer Application (ERTA) is a forthcoming solution crafted to address the critical issue of tracking patient wait times in emergency medical settings. Our primary objective is not solely to minimize waiting times, but to grant patients and their families the freedom to temporarily leave the hospital while awaiting their turn, thereby offering a more accommodating and patient-centric experience. Once implemented, ERTA will notify patients when their turn approaches, eliminating any concerns about missing their spot and enabling them to step out of the often-crowded waiting areas.  

 
Our tool holds the promise of not only diminishing the anxiety that often accompanies extended waiting periods but also enhancing the overall patient experience, optimizing operational efficiency, and elevating the quality of care delivered in emergency rooms. Furthermore, by decreasing the number of people in the waiting room, ERTA contributes to a safer and more hygienic environment, benefiting both patients and hospital staff.
